# Test Plan for Task Management Refactoring

This document outlines the test plan for verifying the refactored task management system in the Bulti application.

## Core Functionality Tests

### Dashboard Loading
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads correctly with the consolidated `useTaskManager` hook
- [ ] Confirm tasks are displayed for the correct dates
- [ ] Verify loading indicator works properly

### Task CRUD Operations
- [ ] Create a new task and verify it appears in the correct date container
- [ ] Edit an existing task and verify changes are saved
- [ ] Delete a task and verify it is removed from the UI
- [ ] Verify task project filtering works properly

### Drag and Drop
- [ ] Test drag and drop within the same date container (reordering)
- [ ] Test drag and drop between different date containers
- [ ] Verify task dates are updated correctly when dragged to a new date
- [ ] Verify tasks remain in the correct order after drag operations

### AI Assistance
- [ ] Test AI planning functionality (chat interface)
- [ ] Verify AI suggestions are displayed correctly
- [ ] Apply AI suggestions and verify tasks are updated as expected

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Test behavior with an empty task list
- [ ] Test behavior when losing internet connection during task operations
- [ ] Test task order preservation during date changes
- [ ] Test with multiple projects assigned to tasks

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] Verify there are no duplicate network requests for tasks
- [ ] Check that state updates are efficient and don't cause unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Verify memory usage is reasonable with a large number of tasks

## UI Consistency

- [ ] Verify that all task operations show appropriate loading/success/error states
- [ ] Confirm that toast notifications are displayed appropriately for task operations
- [ ] Verify task cards display consistent information across all views

## Regression Tests

- [ ] Verify all previous functionality still works as expected
- [ ] Check for any regressions in task date handling
- [ ] Verify project filtering still works correctly
- [ ] Ensure AI planning hasn't been negatively impacted

## Implementation-Specific Tests

### `useTaskManager` Hook
- [ ] Verify it properly combines the functionality of `useTasks` and `useDashboardTasks`
- [ ] Confirm date formatting is consistent across all operations
- [ ] Check that project filtering works correctly
- [ ] Verify task mutations (create/update/delete) work as expected

### Task Store Updates
- [ ] Verify the store focuses only on UI state
- [ ] Confirm AI-related state is managed properly
- [ ] Verify no functionality was lost in the refactoring
